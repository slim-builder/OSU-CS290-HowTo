    <h3>World Bank API Multi-Page Query Response</h3>
    <p>For information about the page parameter for World Bank API queries,

    </p>
    <p>This section focuses on how to deal with the multi-page format of the API
    response data.  In some cases, the amount of data returned from a query
    may be too large to be returned in a single response "page."  For example,
    if you query for a list of all possible data indicators, the total number
    of data indicators provided by the World Bank API is 16,629!  This section
    will demonstrate a way to obtain large amounts of query response data by
    essentially breaking a single large query into several smaller queries using
    the "page" and "pages" query parameters.

    <p>Take a look at the Javascript example below:</p>

    <p>The example above creates three pull-down menus which allow the user
    to select a topic, country, and year.  The three parameters will be used
    to form an API query in the next section.  In the meantime, the example
    code above shows how we can populate the lists of pull-down menu options
    using API queries.  The responses to the API queries also happens to span
    multiple pages.
    </p>
    <p>The most important function in the above code example and the rest of the
    examples presented in this guide is the worldBankApiCall function.  The
    worldBankApiCall function takes parameters such as the name of the JSONP
    prefix function to be called, a partial URL query parameter string, the
    year, and the page number.  These function parameters are combined into
    a single URL query string which forms the API call structure.
    </p>
    <p>The get_topics and get_countries are the prefix functions specified in
    the URL query string.  They are called as part of the JSONP-formatted
    response and their respective response arrays of JSON data are passed in
    to them as parameters.  The prefix functions parse out the data that we
    are interested in, namely the topic ID, the topic value (description),
    the country ID (code), and the country name.  For every response page
    received, the prefix function copies the JSON data of interest into
    another array. The copy operations to another array is necessary because
    the data of interest may need to be accessible to other functions.
    </p>
    <p>For handling multi-page responses to a single URL query type, the API
    response itself contains handy information such as the page number of
    the current response page and the total number of response pages for a
    given API query.  The prefix function uses that information to determine
    whether or not it should send a request for the next page or stop the
    page requests.  Once all the response pages are received and processed,
    the prefix function populates the pull-menus with the correct list of
    topic or country options.

    <div id="page4" class="nav_next_button"><p class="button_text">Next</p></div><br/>
    <div id="page2" class="nav_back_button"><p class="button_text">Back</p></div>
    <script>
      var next = document.getElementById("page4");
      next.onclick=function(){window.location = "snapshot.html";return false;};
      var back = document.getElementById("page2");
      back.onclick=function(){window.location = "jsonp.html";return false;};
    </script>
