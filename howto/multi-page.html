    <h3>World Bank API Multi-Page Query Response</h3>
    <p>For information about the page parameter for World Bank API queries,
    <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/developers/api-overview/basic-call-structure">click here</a>.

    <p>This page focuses on how to deal with the multi-page format of the API
    response data.  In some cases, the amount of data returned from a query
    may be too large to be returned in a single response.  For example, if you
    query for a list of all possible data indicators, the total number of data
    indicators provided by the World Bank API is 16,629!  This page will
    demonstrate a way to obtain large amounts of query response data by
    essentially breaking a single large query into several smaller queries using
    the "page" and "pages" query parameters.
