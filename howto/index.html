    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>The <a href="http://www.worldbank.org">World Bank</a> provides several
    APIs to allow access to its datasets.  One of those APIs involve Indicator
    queries which allows the API user to retrieve various pieces of World Bank
    data.
    </p>
    <p>For example, the indicator called
    "GDP (current US$)" represents the Gross Domestic Product of a country in US
    dollars.  The API user can call the API with a query specifying the GDP
    indicator, a country such as the United States, and a year such as 2010 to
    obtain the 2010 United States GDP in units of US dollars.
    </p>
    <p>The World Bank has some very good API documentation which explains
       how to query for particular data indicators.

    <p>This how-to guide is intended to address a couple of issues you may
    encounter while using the World Bank API Indicator queries such as
    same-origin policy restrictions and the multi-page API responses.
    </p>
    <p>In addition, we will build a new indicator query of
    our own based on the built-in indicator queries provided by the World Bank.
    </p>
    <p>Finally, we will create a simple web application using our newly
    created indicator query.</p>
