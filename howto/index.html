    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The <a href="http://www.worldbank.org">World Bank</a> provides several
    APIs to allow access to its datasets.  One of those APIs involve Indicator
    queries which allows the API user to retrieve various pieces of World Bank
    data.
    </p>
    <p>For example, the indicator called
    "GDP (current US$)" represents the Gross Domestic Product of a country in US
    dollars.  The API user can call the API with a query specifying the GDP
    indicator, a country such as the United States, and a year such as 2010 to
    obtain the 2010 United States GDP in units of US dollars.

    to read the excellent World Bank API documentation which explains how to
    query for particular data indicators.
    </p>
    <p>This how-to guide is intended to address a couple of issues you may
    encounter while using the World Bank API Indicator queries such as
    same-origin policy restrictions and the multi-page API responses.
    </p>
    <p>In addition, we will build a new topic-based query of our own based on
    the built-in indicator queries provided by the World Bank API.
    </p>
    <p>Finally, we will create a simple web application using our newly
    created topic-based query.</p>
