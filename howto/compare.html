    <h2>Building a Topic-Based Query - Part II</h2>
    <h3>Side-by-side Country Comparison of Indicator Data Snapshots</h3>
    <p>This section demonstrates how to extend the web application described
    in the previous section to provide a side-by-side topic comparison of two
    countries for a specific year.  Another variation of an extended web
    application would be a side-by-side comparison of topic data from the same
    country but between two different years.
    </p>
    <p style="font-weight: bold;">
    Warning: The application below may take a very long time (many minutes) to
    finally load all the indicator data values.  Some topics like "Education"
    have a huge dataset size.  Try testing the application with smaller topics
    such as "Millenium development goals" or "Science &amp; Technology."
    </p>
    <p>Check out the following Javascript code below:
    </p>
    <iframe height='500' scrolling='no'
      src='http://codepen.io/slim3629/embed/jqoeQg/?height=500&theme-id=0&default-tab=js,result&embed-version=2'

    <p>The code above is very similar to the code in the previous section but
    extended to handle two countries worth of data instead of one.  Again, the
    API requests are called synchronously with the application querying for
    data to populate one table column (Country #1 indicator data) followed by
    data queries for Country #2 indicator data.  Note that the application only
    displays the data values once all of the data for both countries are
    received and stored in their respective arrays (dataArray1 and dataArray2).
    </p>
    <h3>Another Possible Comparison Application</h3>
    <p>One possible comparison application would be a graph wizard application
    which could produce graphs of topic data with respect to time for a given
    country.  For example, you could create a graph of GDP for the USA from
    year 2000 to year 2005.

    a topic-based query of the World Bank API Indicators.</p>
