    <h2>Building a Topic-Based Query - Part I</h2>
    <h3>Snapshot of All Indicator Data for a Given Topic, Country, and Year</h3>
    <p>For information about World Bank API topic queries,
    <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/developers/api-overview/topic-queries">click here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>This section demonstrates how to create a simple web application which
    allows the user to choose a topic, country, and year with pull-down menus
    and then displays the data for all of the indicators associated with the
    chosen topic.  The results are displayed in a table.  The purpose of the
    application is to create and use a new kind of topic-based query for
    gathering all the indicator data for a specific topic.  The application
    presented in this section happens to display data for a single country and
    year which may be viewed as an annual "snapshot" of a country's
    data for a given topic.
    </p>
    <p>Take a look at the following Javascript example code below:
    </p>

    <p>The example code above adds a "Get Data" button to the pull-down menus
    developed in the previous section.  Upon clicking the button, the
    application generates a table containing columns for the user-specified
    year and topic, the indicator code, the indicator description, and the
    indicator data values for the user-specified country.
    </p>
    <p>One of the most important points is that each successive World Bank API
    request in the example is synchronous.  This is because there is only one
    event ("Get Data" button click) associated with a large number of API
    requests (many indicator queries).  Keep in mind that the list of indicator
    codes for a topic are being looped through to create the API requests.
    Since the data from each API response corresponds to a particular indicator
    code (table row) and the API responses do not always contain the indicator
    code within them, then the API response data must be received and processed
    in order and stored in an ordered array.  Therefore the example web
    application may load its data value column (the rightmost column of the
    table) very slowly since the application must wait for an API response from
    the previous API request before sending out the next API request.
    </p>
    <p>The World Bank API server also appears to have a security measure which
    limits the number of requests which can be made within a fixed time period.
    This is the reason why the setTimeout function is used in the prefix
    functions named "get_data1."  The calls to setTimeout specify a 300
    millisecond delay before making each successive API request in order to
    stay below the API request limit.  The security measure may also contribute
    to the slow load times of the application results.
    </p>
    <p>The drawTable function also immediately displays the table with the
    user-selected year, user-selected topic, topic indicator code, and topic
    indicator description columns populated with values from the
    indicatorsArray and year and topicText variables.  The rightmost column
    values are not displayed until all of the API response data have been
    received and stored in the dataArray1 array.  The displayData1 function
    populates the rightmost table column with the proper indicator data.
    The displayData1 function also prints out "N/A" whenever it encounters
    a null value.  The API returns a null value when the indicator data is not
    available.
    </p>
    <h3>Possible Improvement</h3>
    <p>One possible improvement would be to use asynchronous calls to the
    API in order to improve overall load time.  One way to implement
    asynchronous calls would be to add a unique "Get Data" button next to each
    table row which would fetch the data pertaining to a single indicator.
    In this way, there would be many more unique button click events on which
    the application could make asynchronous API requests.

      var next = document.getElementById("page5");

      back.onclick=function(){window.location = "multi-page.html";return false;};
